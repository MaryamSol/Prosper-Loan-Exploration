## by Maryam Ibrahim

## Dataset

> The dataset consisted of borrower APRs and other attributes. There are total of 113937 loans entries saved in the dataset and 81 attributes. Each loan contain information on the borrowered's background information and other details like BorrowerAPR, StatedMonthlyIncome, Term, ProsperRating (Alpha), EmploymentStatus and many others.

## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, borrowers with the best Prosper ratings have the lowest APR. I found a positive relationship between LoanOriginalAmount and StatedMonthlyIncome. The loan amount is also increased with the increase of loan term. I also found that borrowers with better ratings have larger monthly income and loan amount. There is only 36 months loans for HR rating borrowers. For loan amount, there is a interaction between term and rating. With better Prosper rating, the loan amount of all three terms increases, the increase amplitude of loan amount between terms also becomes larger.the borrower APR decrease with the increase of borrow term for people with HR-C raings. But for people with B-AA ratings, the APR increase with the increase of borrow term.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> I focused on BorrowerAPR and how other factors such as Loan Amount, ProsperRating, and Term could affect it.
